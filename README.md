<b>You have to edit main .py file and put instead of "eth0" your network card name. You can find it by typing in terminal "ip addr".</b></br>
<b>You have to install network-manager and macchanger with apt install to get this script work. </b></br>
I suggest you to make an alias for easy make the script work.
